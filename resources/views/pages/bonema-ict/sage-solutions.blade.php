    <p>
      Many companies have grown organically and have deployed over a
      number of years, various legacy software applications coming from
      numerous suppliers and on different platforms. This has led to
      situation were maintenance costs are high, there is a lot of
      manual re-inputting of data between systems, there are a number of
      customer databases, and it is difficult to get a high level
      management view of the operation. Bonema Technologies has
      experience in analysing existing set-ups and in then recommending
      a roadmap for the implementation of next generation solutions.
